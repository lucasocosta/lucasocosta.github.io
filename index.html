  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me 🎯</h2>
    <p>I’m a passionate Tech Lead and Software Engineer with over a decade of experience in software development. I started working with web technologies at the age of 13, and since then, I have been fascinated by the endless possibilities of building systems. Currently, I lead a development team focused on building scalable solutions, always striving for clean architecture and efficiency.</p>

    <p>My technical expertise spans across various frameworks and languages such as NodeJS, Ruby on Rails, Python, TypeScript, and Java. I am deeply involved with cloud solutions, particularly AWS, and specialize in using microservices and CI/CD pipelines to deliver high-quality software. As a team leader, I integrate both SCRUM and Kanban methodologies to optimize workflows and ensure team growth.</p>

    <p>I’m always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to push boundaries, whether it's in backend development, cloud architecture, or team leadership. Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to see some of the projects I’ve worked on, or connect with me on LinkedIn to learn more about my professional journey.</p>
